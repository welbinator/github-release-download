Block that adds a button users can use to download the latest release from your github repo.

== Description ==

GitHub Release Download is a simple block plugin for WordPress that allows you to create a customizable button that downloads the latest release from any public GitHub repository.

Just enter the repository URL (e.g. https://github.com/user/repo) and customize the button text in the editor. On the front end, the button dynamically fetches the latest release using the GitHub API. If the release has downloadable assets, the first one is downloaded. If not, the plugin automatically falls back to the auto-generated source ZIP for the release tag.

No PHP rendering is required â€” everything is handled via JavaScript using the WordPress block system and AJAX.

== Installation ==

If you don't know how to install a plugin, this plugin isn't for you.
